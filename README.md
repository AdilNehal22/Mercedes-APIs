# Mercedes-APIs
I created the CRUD APIs and tried to make Mercedes website backend server. 
I used JSON as a database to fetch some basic data. 
I used JSON as databse because at the time I made this project I never learned the database.

I made this after learning express and set server with it and Node.js. 
The APIs I made are. to create data, patch data, read data, delete data. 
I also created a middleware to authorize the request body plus, I used some library middlewares too.
