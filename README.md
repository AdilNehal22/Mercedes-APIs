# Mercedes-APIs
I created the REST CRUD APIs and tried to make Mercedes website backend server. 
I used MongoDB and Mongoose to fetch some basic data. 

I made this after learning express and set server with it and Node.js. 
The APIs I made are. to create data, patch data, read data, delete data. 
I also created an express middleware to authorize the request body plus mongoose middleware 
document middleware to encrypt the data and then save it.
I used some library middlewares too.
Implemented the better error handling and then better authentication and authorization system with Single Sign On technology.
